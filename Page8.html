These notes were taken while walking through the city; pausing at intersections, standing under traffic lights, watching reflections move across glass towers. I wasn't looking for landmarks. I was looking for signals.
</p>
<p>Micro-observations I found while walking:</p>
<ul class="notes2">
  <li>A crosswalk button that clicks but does nothing.</li>
  <li>A sticker layered over five older stickers.</li>
  <li>A bike lane symbol worn down to a ghost outline.</li>
  <li>A curb cut that leads into a patch of dirt.</li>
  <li>A sign pointing left even though the path curves right.</li>
  <li>A puddle reflecting a traffic light.</li>
</ul>

                <p>I noticed a small path cutting across the grass behind the library. It was not part of the official sidewalk system, but it was clearly used every day. The dirt was packed down and the edges were soft from people stepping slightly off the line. It made me think about how people create their own routes when the designed ones do not match how they actually move. The city tries to guide us, but our habits leave their own marks.</p>

                <p>On my walk home I saw a sign that had been twisted slightly to the left. It still pointed in the same general direction, but the angle felt wrong, like it had been bumped by a truck or turned by someone messing around. Even though the change was small, it made the whole corner feel off. It reminded me that signals are not permanent. They shift, fade, and get altered by weather and people, and the meaning changes with them.</p>
