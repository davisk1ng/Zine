            <h1>City as Interface</h1>
            <p>The more I practice this kind of slow looking, the more the city feels like something I can actually read. It is not just a place I move through on my way to class or work. It becomes a system that I can understand and question. I start to notice which signals help people and which ones limit them. I notice where the city invites movement and where it blocks it. I notice the difference between official instructions and the paths people create on their own.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Paying attention to these signals does not solve every problem in the city, but it does change the way I experience it. I feel more connected to the spaces I walk through every day. I feel more aware of the choices that were made long before I arrived. Most of all, I feel more curious. There is always another sign, another mark, another small clue about how the city works. Once you start noticing them, it becomes hard to stop.</p>
